### Recommended resources:

B. Kernighan and D. Ritchie, C Programming Language, 2nd Edition, Prentice Hall, 1988. (Since the C programming language is a proper subset of the C++ programming language, if you know C++, you pretty much know C already. However, things available in C++, such as strings and streams, are not be available in C. So, you need to know how to do things such as manipulating null-terminated array of characters and performing I/O in C.)
